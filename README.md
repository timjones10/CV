## About

I'm a full stack junior developer with a background in operational risk in finance, political risk consultancy and the military.

I've led teams from infantry soldiers in Helmand Province, to intelligence analysts in Iraq. I built a political and security risk consultancy within a larger company focussed on the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. At Barclays I focussed on preventing unexpected risk events in the front office of the Investment Bank including working with developers to produce risk and control tools. 

As a developer this experience means I'm calm in the face of complexity, love working in a pair or a team and quickly grasp the user requirements and broader context of the software deployment.

I became a developer because I want to actively solve problems, be creative every day, and love learning. I did a distance-learning Masters whilst deployed overseas and ran the Lessons Learnt process in Barclays Investment Bank, before learning to develop software at Makers Academy. I want my work as a developer to be part of the positive, trnasformative change that Technology is driving in organisations and communites across the world.
