## Tim Jones

Working with People. Problem Solving. Learning.

Professionally these are the three things I love and three things I'm best at.

I thrive as a member of a team and have contributed to teams (and teams of teams) of different sizes across the public and private sector in front line, client facing and analytical support roles.

I'm really experienced in planning and driving projects forward. From the scope through final delivery to after-action review, I'm good at adapting if the situation changes, keeping an eye on the goal and maintaining momentum.

I'm curious and face down complexity in order to get to the bottom of things. Professionally, if I'm not learning I'm not happy. This has meant that within the right role, the value I deliver, and my personal fulfilment increases over time.

I've sought out challenging roles across the public and private sector and succeeded in all of them. I've never turned down a challenge. I volunteered for all my hardest tasks.

Technology's changed the world and since 'we aint seen nothing yet' I've pivoted my career to focus on developing software so I can be part of this ongoing change. I want to work for a product or organisation that is making a better society and world.


## Skills

#### Analysis

As part of a huge Special Forces Headquarters I analysed and moved intelligence to improve management understanding. I did as part of a team of analysts across multiple locations globally. I transferred these skills to the private sector where I designed frameworks for analysing security and political risks and delivered reports to clients (private, public and charity organisations) to allow them to operate in new markets.

#### Simplifying Complexity

Across my roles in the public and private sector, I've won praise and delivered value for my ability to provide insight by simplifying tough problems. At Barclays I was chosen to engage with senior Managing Directors across Sales and Trading to explain a new risk and control tool because of my ability to cut through complexity and communicate concisely.

#### Planning and Delivery

I built on my work in specialist planning roles in the Army while delivering projects in the Investment Bank, a large and complex organisation where change was constant. When progress is slow or difficult I've the got the energy, experience and mental agility to suggest solutions and keep things moving. I've regularly led stalled meetings to agreement or decision by identifying and articulating the issue and recommending next steps.


#### Communication

I delivered verbal briefings (in person and over Skype) and written reports to paying clients during my work as a Risk and Advisory Manager. I'm comfortable speaking across diverse teams and have the emotional intelligence to quickly read the dynamics of a room. I produced written reports at Barclays which clearly summarised and communicated complex risk events across dozens of businesses and hundreds of systems and processes.
